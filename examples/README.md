## SeaLion Jupyter Notebooks

In this folder all the files stored are jupyter notebooks. They use real-world datasets like iris, moons, breast cancer, MNIST, etc. to demonstrate the applications
of sealion. I also showed a lot of the data preprocessing and visualization stages, with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib - so that could be helpful. Enjoy!
